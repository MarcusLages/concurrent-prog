- a condition must be used with a mutex
goroutine 1:                             goroutine 2: 
	lock mutex                               lock mutex
	as long as condition is false            make condition true
	  wait on cond variable                    signal/broadcast cond variable
	// do work                               unlock mutex
	unlock mutex
